    "# New York City: SAT Results, 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "<i>The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is an exam U.S. high school students take before applying to college. The SAT consists of three sections, each with 800 possible points, making 2,400 the highest possible combined score. Colleges factor SAT scores when deciding who to admit. Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "    \n",
    "SAT's fairness to marginalized groups is a controversial issue in US education. Investigating correlations between SAT scores and key demographic factors requires a dive into big societal issues concerning race, gender, and wealth gap (to name a few).</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its [data on high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online, as well as the demographics for each high school. Here are the datasets used in this notebook:\n",

    "\n",
    "Some notes prior to reading the datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although the total SAT score has changed a few times, score datasets for this project is based on a 2,400 total. \n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a district borough number, or DBN.\n",
    "- New York City schools fall within several different school districts. Aggregating data by district allows mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
    "- Since only high school students take the SAT, certain data sets need to be cleaned to only include high schools.\n",
    "- New York City has a significant immigrant population, which makes it one of the most diverse in the country. Because of this, there is usually enough data to compare or correlate demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores. The NYC SAT scores may provide enough data to unearth biases in SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Reading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To have a convenient way of storing and referencing these datasets, each file will be saved as a pandas dataframe, and then store all of the dataframes in a dictionary. The first part involves reading the .csv files, which can be seen below."

This could indicate that women do better on the SAT than men.\n",

Most of the high schools with low total enrollment and low SAT scores have high percentages of English language learners. This indicates that it's actually `ell_percent` that correlates strongly with `sat_score`, rather than `total_enrollment`. To explore this relationship further, below is a plot for `ell_percent` vs `sat_score`."

    "Unfortunately, due to the number of schools, it's hard to interpret the map above. It looks like uptown Manhattan and parts of Queens have a higher `ell_percent`, but it's difficult to be certain. One way to make very granular statistics easier to read is to aggregate them. In this case, we can aggregate by district, which will enable us to plot `ell_percent` district-by-district instead of school-by-school."
