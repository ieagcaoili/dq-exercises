    "There are two datasets, both from employee exit surveys: [one from DETE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey), and [another from TAFE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey). A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset. In a job setting, we'd make sure to meet with a manager to confirm the definitions of the data. For this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.\n",

    "| SeparationType | The reason why the person's employment ended |\n",

    "In this project, the aim is to combine both surveys to find out if newer employees (those who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time) are resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction. Included in the aim is to understand if older employees are resigned due to dissatisfaction."
