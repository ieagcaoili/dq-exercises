    "Apps for eBooks, libraries, and dictionaries dominate the 'Book and Reference' genre, so avoiding these top types is logical. Looking at the second tier of popular apps, the few apps build around Quran — even the app build around the Bible — suggests that building an app around a popular book can be profitable. \n",

    "It seems that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. To distinguish the app from competition, it may be necessary to add special features, such as: daily quotes from the book, an audiobook companion, quizzes or interactive lessons, a in-app forum, etc."
