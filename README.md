# Revised Dataquest Exercises

These notebooks were made of practice code from Dataquest's own development environment and guided projects. 

Upon review, it was apparent that the code could be improved. Because chapter lessons and guided projects were tied to an outline, the notebooks leaned towards repetitive code that highlighted specific Python concepts.

Although the bare bones of the chapters (datasets, exercises, conceptual framework) were lifted from Dataquest courses, most of the code were reworked to improve flow, and to practice thinking Pythonically.
