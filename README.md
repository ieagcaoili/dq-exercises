# Revised Dataquest Exercises

These notebooks were revised versions of practice code from Dataquest's Data Scientist path. 

Upon review, it was apparent that the code could be improved. Because chapter lessons and guided projects were tied to an outline, the notebooks had code that got repeated multiple times, to highlight specific Python concepts. Although the bare bones of the chapters (datasets, exercises, conceptual framework) were lifted from Dataquest courses, the code had been reworked to improve flow and to practice thinking Pythonically.
